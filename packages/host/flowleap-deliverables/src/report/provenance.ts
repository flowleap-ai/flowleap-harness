/**
 * Generated provenance for a saved patent report. A landscape report is a page of numbers, and an
 * FTO memo is a page of legal statuses, dates and quoted claims; a figure, a date or a quotation
 * whose origin is not recorded cannot be checked by the reader. This module derives from the
 * session's execution record, and states in the saved document:
 *
 * - which figures in the body appear in the text an analytics, status or search tool actually returned,
 * - which of the rest are row totals, column sums or shares of the report's own tables,
 * - which tables state the unit they count (families, applications, publications, hits),
 * - which dates appear in the text a tool returned, and
 * - which claim quotations match, word for word, the claim text the record holds for the publication
 *   the quotation is cited to.
 *
 * No check rejects a save. A figure that is not found may be a correct hand calculation, a table
 * without a basis word may state it in prose above, and an unmatched quotation may be a faithful
 * translation or an excerpt of a section the record does not hold. They are disclosures: they tell
 * the reader what was not mechanically traced back to a recorded tool output, and naming the column
 * behind a sum lets a mislabelled period show itself.
 *
 * Kept free of `vscode` and of the extension's service graph, like {@link patentSecondRead}: the
 * ledger snapshot is described here by a structural type that the real `PatentExecutionSnapshot` is
 * assignable to, so the shaping is unit-testable in isolation.
 *
 * Local divergence from the IDE copy (S5 acceptance defect A, 2026-10-25; see the README, "What
 * differs from the IDE copy"): {@link extractFigures} also drops a prose reference to one of the
 * memo's own section numbers ("the table in 4.1"), and `containsNumber` accepts a figure followed by
 * a list comma (`"adjustmentTotalQuantity": 63,` in a JSON tool result) while still refusing a
 * thousands group (`63,000`). {@link ftoProvenanceResult} also takes the document it names, so a
 * dossier or another non-FTO save is not told about an "FTO" memo (S5 acceptance pass 3,
 * 2026-10-26).
